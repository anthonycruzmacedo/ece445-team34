## High-Level Requirements

- The dynamic seat cushion fits within the dimensions 22in Wide x 15in Deep x 4in High so as to contrain the product to an appropriate size for standard wheelchairs.
- The sensor array detects when the time threshold is met for each area that meets or exceed the pressure threshold. The time threshold is set by the user in multiples of 5 minutes. The pressure threshold is to be defined (options include user-set PSI, percentage of high-low differential)
- When an area meets the time and pressure thresholds, the cushion bladder inflates in surrounding areas to a new pressure that drops the original area's pressure below the pressure threshold.
