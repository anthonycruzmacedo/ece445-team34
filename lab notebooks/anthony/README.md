### Week of 09/11

- First TA meeting with Jeff Chang, discussed initial ideas and expectations for weekly TA meetings.
- First meeting with Dr. Golecki, Jason Robinson, and Eliot Bethke. Discussed expectations, ideas, implementations to look into, etc. Noted that we were between two proposals and our partnership was dependent on approval from course staff.
- Finalized RFA/proposal for dynamic seat cushion.

### Week of 09/18

- Second TA meeting, discussed requirements for design document and design review.
- Met with Dr. Golecki and Jason to further discuss requirements of design doc, ideation, etc. Also discussed the air module options available and researched the Programmable Air's GitHub page.
- Read data sheet and decided on sensor part FSR UX 406 by Interlink Electronics for the force sensing array.

### Week of 09/25

- Third TA meeting, clarified more requirements of design document and review to adequately complete assignment and prepare.
- Started on circuit schematics for force sensor array, decided to use dual 4:1 MUXs, op-amps, and STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller
- Finalized high-level requirements with Dr. Golecki's group.

### Week of 10/03

- Created initial visual diagram of the project demonstrating functional overview on Figma.
- Finalized circuit schematic for FSR array.
- Finalized tolerance analysis.
- Researched parts needed for project.
- Worked with group to finalize design document and prepare for upcoming review.
